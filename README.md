## Review

Who'd have thought turn-based racing to be the future of racing games? Not me,
anyway. In any case, I love this game with all my heart. It's almost flawlessly
executed - great graphics, splendid gameplay, and technically very impressive.
This is 4k at its best!
Great graphics, excellent gameplay, and technically excellent.

## Where can I play?

Unfortunately the game is offline.
I you want to play it you have to build it yourself or execute the `V.jar` file.

For instance in IntelliJ IDEA:

* create a Java project
* add V.java to the src
* create an Application run configuration and run it
