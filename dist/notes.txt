Vector Racer 4k (Harm Boschloo)

Who'd have thought turn-based racing to be the future of racing games? Not me, 
anyway. In any case, I love this game with all my heart. It's almost flawlessly
executed - great graphics, splendid gameplay, and technically very impressive.
This is 4k at its best!
Great graphics, excellent gameplay, and technically excellent.
